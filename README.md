J2MEBluetoothChat
=================

A Bluetooth Chat Application for J2ME based Mobile Phones.

Features:

- Add your UserName
- A scrollable message box.
- Beep or Vibrate on new message.
- Show "User is typing..." when the other user starts typing.
- Added Some Emoticons.
- Ticker Displaying last message and its recieve time.

If you have a touch phone, then add the following lines in the J2MEBluetoothChat.jad file to remove
the virtual keypad that occupies extra area in the bottom:

MIDlet-Touch-Support: true

You will have to install the application from the JAD file to get the full screen working.

I will keep on updating and adding new features from time to time.

I currently intend to:

- Improve the GUI
- Improve Connectivity
- Add Support for different phones.
- Implement over the Internet Client-Server Connection. (I would have to rename the repositary then!)

Till then
Get the most out of it!
